This is Dragonball Truth v1.8

You are allowed to use all the areas, objs, mobs, shops, help files, code
and anything else you find in the code. Be sure to check everything out before
you change things, as you might end up screwing up. A lot of things are used
that are not named exactly as they are. This was done out of laziness initially.

I have gone through and labled many of the functions, so it is obvious what they
do. If you use this, make sure to leave the do_version credits as they are. You
may add to them, but do not alter what is already there. If you do, there isn't
anything that can be done to you, but you will know deep down that you are a
lying bastard.

Enjoy,

Ver 1.8 changes:
1: Fixed a compile error.
2: Removed a bug that caused crashes when socials were used during fight.

P.S.: Make sure to change Drango and Thon in act.wizard.c to two names you want,
and make them names no one else knows and that you will remember. Those two names
have the ability to use the command "thismudismine" which sets the character to
1000014. An emergency command to regain control of your mud should you lose it.

Make sure if you are using a player file from before this version that you go into
structs.h and search for:

long mana;
long max_mana;
long hit;
long max_hit;

and change the long to int or else your player file may be corrupted.
