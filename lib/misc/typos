Udaphos  (Jun 10) [10020] hereto = here to
Udaphos  (Jun 10) [10045] maketplace = marketplace, residental = residential
Udaphos  (Jun 10) [10046] maketplace = marketplace

Mhurzin  (Jun 11) [10146] There are large spaces in the middle multiple sentences and the sentence is cut in half and continues on the line below.
Mhurzin  (Jun 11) [10665] Third sentence it says cna and it should say "can"
Mhurzin  (Jun 14) [ 2145] the word entire is spelled wrong, spelled intire
Mhurzin  (Jun 14) [ 2144] last sentence doesn't make sense
Mhurzin  (Jun 15) [ 7409] Ok, this isn't necessarily a typo, just a suggestion...The desc should be re-written because using the same word, such as fill and structure in consecutive sentences makes the paragraph choppy and not read well.
Mhurzin  (Jun 15) [ 7420] The last sentence reads, "In the distance you can hear the various sounds of animlas and air is hot and muggy." I believe that there should be a 'the' in the sentence so it reads, "In the distance you can hear the various sounds of animals and THE air is hot and muggy."

Udaphos  (Jun 16) [ 2337] An Icer Jail Bitch stands her flaunting here = her
Mhurzin  (Jun 16) [ 1423] The second sentence I think it should say 'baked goods' not 'baked good', in the last sentence, it doesn't make very much sense, I think it should say "The owner is a kindly women, who does what she loves the most all day, baking."
Mhurzin  (Jun 16) [ 1425] The last part of the sentence it should be hanging and not hangs because of the start of the sentence being  'which has'
Udaphos  (Jun 19) [10832] inear = in it's center, or near it's center?
