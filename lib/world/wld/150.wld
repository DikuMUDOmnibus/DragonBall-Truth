   &00&07The room is made of smooth pearly white stones.  Hanging from the
ceiling is a large iron cast lantern casting shadows across the room.  
Gleaming weapons line the smooth walls.  A large firepit is in the center of
the room, black ashes making up the contents.  The smell of scented candles
lingers in the air, yet the room is cool and comfortable.

   &15This large shadowy shop is one of the most secretive pawnshops around.  
Anything brought here is sold under complete confidentialty, and plenty is sold
here.  Large display booths show off previous merchandise, as well as racks on
the walls.  A completely fenced in counter hides the untrusting shopkeeper, and
heat sensors are all around to discourage even the best konatsu from going
invisible in the store.  &00

to form a seemless building.  Weapons and armor that appear out of this
universe hang from every nook and crany of the shop.  They are even piled up on

Near the back of the room is a small counter where the shopkeepers does his

   &16Before you stands the small fortress housing young Konatsu's just
beginning their long and difficult journey through life.  The wooden walls line
the perimeter standing 50 feet high.  A giant two door gate looms in front of
the path casting a shadow over the cobblestone path.  The sounds of life can be
heard coming from inside and the smell of sweat and grit fills the air.  &00

   &00&04The mouth of the cave looks ancient and worn forming a large
semicircle as each end dissapears into the ground.  Plants of all sorts can be
seen growing out of cracks and chinks in the rock.  A aura of power seems to
radiate from within the cave making your skin tingle and all the noise from the
camp seems quiter and very far away.  Inside it looks dark and murky.

   &12The large chamber is in the shape of a hexagon and is covered in runes
similar to those in the tunnels.  The ceiling is dome shaped and are huge
muriels depicting ancient warriors fighting each other to the death.  In the
center of the floor rises unto a pedistal standing a foot off the ground
covered with dried blood and the bones of fallen warriors.  An eerie silence
pervades the room and the smell of death is almost unbearable.

   &00&01Hot streams of lava flow through channels all around the entrance to
this volcano.  Dark black rock makes up most of the formations of the volcano,
where lava cooled long ago.  Choking gases belch out of the entrance every few

plain and unadorned except for the giant mural on the ceiling depicting two
warriors sparring each other.  Torches flicker in the breeze and the shouting
of fighters in other rooms can be heard all around.  The smell of sweet and
persperation lingers heavily in the air.  Up a set of spiraling stairs leads to
the sparring room while to the east and south leads to the training and jogging
rooms.

seems to envigorate even the most weary of souls.  Benches and beds line on
either side of the tent, leaving a small walkway up the middle.  As the wind
howls through the tent flaps a almost melodic voice can almost be heard.  To

trainers getting a little to rough and small bloodstains can be seen on the
training mats here and there.  Torches line the wall casting most of the room

   &09Thick streams of red hot lava flow through here, pooling in the shallow
center before being pushed out through one of the many channels.  The fumes are
as thick as a cloud in this room, leaving few of the creatures found elsewhere

   &00&01A large hole in the volcano floor near the north is constantly spewing
out lava here into a thick stream flowing through the middle of the floor.  
The gasses are less here, but not by much.  The creatures living in the volcano
seem to have taken a liking to the relativly safe exspanse of this room.  &00

   &15This is a strange shop in an odd place.  Metal gratings have been built
ontop of the lava rock, allowing streams of magma to flow safly beneath the
shop floor.  Giant vents suck out the noxious fumes to make it a more
comfortable shopping experience for anyone crazy enough to buy stuff in a
volcano.  &00

as thick as a cloud in this room, leaving few of the creatures found elsewhere

suprizingly clear, flowing past small and large rocks alike in the creek bed.
Small fish swim through the deeper parts of the creek, surfacing to catch

Entrance Ramp~
   &00&07 You walk in onto the grates as the steel doors slam behind you,
kicking up a cloud of dust.  You continue forward and stop directly in-front of
a speaker box mounted onto the wall.  In a loud robotic voice "Prepare for
decontamination!  " Jets of steam come bursting out from every direction,
knocking you onto you back and leaving you smoldering on the floor.  
"Decontamination Complete!  " and with that the front wall splits revealing a
small step ladder leading down to another room.  &00

   &16You enter the room and look up to see a 20 foot statue of
&00&01K&09u&15v&09o&00&01c &16 staring down at you with a look of
&00&01p&09u&00&01r&09e &00&01e&09v&00&01i&09l &16on his face.  Of the smaller
statues, the closest to &00&01K&09u&15v&09o&00&01c &16resembles the infamous
&00&06S&14e&15ku&12r&00&04a &16kneeling down to Kuvoc.  The three statues
behind Sekura seem to resemble &00&07M&15a&11r&00&03z&16, &11G&15o&00&03k&11u
&16and &12V&00&04e&14g&16e&12t&00&04a.  &16The flawless statues are all placed
in prayer together showing the bond between Sekura and his three captains.

   &00&07The room is full of tables surrounded by chairs and arranged to look
like a classroom with a big board at the end of the room.  It shows signs of
being used as a place to plan strategies and eminates a sense of evil all
throughout it commanding the honor of the clan's cause.  &00

   &16This room is rather dimly lit.  Engulfed in the shadows, many exotic
weapons are lined up across the walls from planets all over the universe.  The
western wall, however, has a rather large cabinet against it containing various
equipment and goods both stolen and bought.  In the center of the room stands a
counter with a Regime slave behind it waiting for new recruits to receive their
issued clan gear.  &00

   &00&01This huge room holds the main control pannel and a master computer
controll ing pretty much everthing with the whole ship.  This room truly is
amazing showing tha t the Dark Regime is not only powerful and organized but
genius as well.  The technolo gy within this place is extremly advance and
really confusing to understand for anyon e without high knoledge on these kind
of things.  Luckely it seems the ship is able to control itself even, truly
amazing.  &00

   &00&06While walking into this monstrous training ground you feel the gravity
is hundreds of times stronger, pulling you toward the floor.  You look around
the room and notice the battle scars in the walls.  Reminders of how tough the
training is to be among the Dark Regime's numbers.  &00
