   &15Suffering from lack of tourism the locals decided to add this nice spa.
Anyone who uses it is bound to heal minor injuries and warm away their stress.
Most normal beings can't take the spa's heat and the outside heat as well, so
this room is climate controlled at big exspense and little profit for the
locals.  &00

from a crack along the edge of the slab.  Small bugs crawl through the dirt

entrance, giving an errie glow to the room.  A draft in the room is comeing

have shelves built into them with the remains of long deceased demons on them.
The smell of death premeates this passage, and a cool wind blows from the east
causing the torches to flutter.  &00

   &15This room is quite simple.  There is a bed to the north, a small dresser
to the south, and a small closet which is full of turtle shells to the east.  
This looks like the room of someone who doesn't need a lot to add personality
to their room.  &00

offer every kind of coffee and serve only the best!  Ground coffee lines the
walls giving off a delicious aroma.  Workers behind the counter rush back and
forth, working on the different machines as they try to serve everyone as
quickly as possible.  &00

   &16This small pub is known for its famous burgers.  The room is dark but
cozy and has a slight haze from the smokers at the bar.  The grill sizzles
behind the counter and the smells are mouthwatering.  &00

   &15This smooth stone building seems to be a mixture of ancient style
architecture and modern equipment.  Computer banks have been installed in
several stone alcoves along the walls, and rows of ATMs have been placed in the
center of the room.  Large white lights hang over head, completely lighting up
the room.  &00

   &15This long ladder leads back up to Yema.  It was placed here to allow
access for Goz and Mez who got tired of going the long way.  Anyone from hell
caught on it will lose their body if spotted, no questions asked.  &00
