   &16This is the interplanetary transport for Metropolis Prime.  The top of

   &16There are a few counters here, with helpful saiyans setting behind them.
This is where new visitors register for passes to the planet, or they wouldnt
be allowed outside the pyramid's front door.  This hub also works as the local
