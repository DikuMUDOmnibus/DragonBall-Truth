   &00&16The entrance to the cave is damp, and long tendrils of moss hang from
the ceiling.  Stalactites and stalagmites protruded from the roof and floor,

are draped with a glowing moss, it's light filling the whole room.  By that

blown larger by some great force.  It still curves, and is angled down, but a

   &03Now past the rock wall, which already closes, you can see the vastness of
the cavern before you.  A massive waterfall tumbles down the far side, and
culminates in a vast pool.  A river runs from tht pool, snaking it's way across
to this side f the cavern.  Several waterwheels are placed along it to collect
power.  &00

   &00&12A broad flight of stairs leads down towards a large flat terrace,
which appears to lead West.  The terrace seems to have been carved out of some
strage stone by a massive force.  Along both sides is an odd feathered pattern.
The sound of the waterfall is muted here, creating a pleasant ambience.  &00

   &00&12This is the first of several terraces.  This one leads South, the path
inlaid into the stone with a stange, amber-like one.  Everything in this city
appears to be spotless.  Light comes from apparently nowhere, and there is a
distinct lack of poluttion so notable in other cities in the universe.  A few
people are lounging about on the stone benches around the terrace.  They all
bear massive white wings on their backs.  &00

   &00&12The terrace ends at the head of another flight of broad stairs, but
the clear amber stone continues to run through the centre of the stone.  
Standing to the side of the stairs is one of the winged people, dressed in a

   &00&12A broad flight of stairs leads down towards a large flat terrace,

strage stone by a massive force.  Along both sides is an odd feathered pattern.
The sound of the waterfall is muted here, creating a pleasant ambience.  &00

   &00&03This is one of the major intersections of the city.  Amethyst Street
and Amber Avenue meet here, and the combintion of their two inlays send up a
massive pillar of light, larger than any of the corners by far.  A large device
sits around the beam, controlling and stabilizing it, ensuring it doesn't
explode.  Four Sia'ngelius Knights patrol the intersection, making certain
nobody tampers with the controls.  &00

   &14The broad strip of amber stone comes to an end at a pillar of light,
mingling with the clear strip of diamond which stretches both East and West.  
Though not as large as the pillar in the centre of the city, it is still a
fairly large beam of light, with benches and what look to be students standing
around the pillar.  &00

   &00&14This is the intersection of Sapphire Street and Emerald Lane.  The two
gems inlaid into the streets come together in a magnificent pillar of light
here, reaching up to the cavern roof, and supplying light to this quarter of
the city.  There are some Sia'ngelius and Nameks standing about watching the
pilar of light endlessly cascade into the sky.  &00

   &02Stretching North and South, this lane is inlaid with a wide, feathered
strip of emerald, lit from beneath by some unknown source of light.  The river
stands at the side of the road, and there are several boats sitting in docks.
A few are floating on the wide river, and the sound of laughter drifts towards
this side of the bank.  &00

   &02Stretching North and South, this lane is inlaid with a wide, feathered
strip of emerald, lit from beneath by some unknown source of light.  The river
stands at the side of the road, and there are several boats sitting in docks.
A few are floating on the wide river, and the sound of laughter drifts towards
this side of the bank.  &00

brilliant emerald and amethyst colors together.  More benches, and more people
walk or sit around this intersection.  There are more hotels along the sides of

   &00&15This shop is filled with glass cases, most holding weapons.  Along one
wall are swords, starting from short swords that barely qualify, to a massive
eight-foot greatsword.  Behind a massive oaken counter is a Saiyan.  His eyes
are an emerald green, flecked with silver, and his hair has four silver streaks
in it.  His face is serious, and he sits with his chair tilted back, and feet
resting on the counter.  &00

   &14In the centre of all planets, there is a small asteriod, unknown about by
mortals.  It is rumoured that it is the last place of refuge for the Gods, and
that they retreat there to discuss what they have done, and will do.  In the
centre of the asteroid is a massive chamber, that shines at all time of the
day.  There is a massive table of the finest wood in the precise centre of the
room, and nine chairs surround this table.  &00&04There is a chair and robe of
royal blue, between the pearly white and deep green chairs.  Behind this chair
is a siberian tiger, crouched upon a boulder.  &00 &00&07Behind the pearly
white chair is a snowy white owl, hovering over a white wolf, superimposed upon
a cresent moon.  &00 &00&05Behind a chair of brave purple and robes of matching
hue is a griffon, imposed upon two crossed swords.  &00 &00&01Engraved in the
wall behind a chair and robe made of blood is a serpentine dragon, curled
before a mural of a blazing white star.  &00 &16Directly across from the royal
blue chair is a shapeless shape, that defies both physics and logic.  Another
void sits over the first.  Behind it is a shadowy raven with outstretched
wings, with a star forever consumed by black flame in the centre of its breast.
&00 &15Beside the twin voids is another chair, made of a black substance that,
along with the accompaning robes, is reminiscent of death itself.  Behind it is
a katana, surrounded by blue flame, it's tip dripping crimson blood.  It is
superimposed on a black phoenix, engulfed in a vibrant orange flame.  &00
&00&06Long teal robes are draped over a matching chair, and behind it is a full
circle, the bottom half submerged in the ocean, and the top half breaking over
the horizon in a beautiful sunrise.  &00 &00&10Behind a brilliant green chair,
with matching color robes draped over it, is a Gem, with the Power Kanji
engraved into it, sitting atop a pedastal engulfed in vibrant green flames.

exposes a vast sweep of stars.  In front of the window is a raised dais.  &00
