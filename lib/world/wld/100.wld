sells souveniers, another sells weapons, and the last armor.  Large crowds of
Nameks travel betwen shops, and there are quite a few security guards about.

   &10Here the land gives way to the vast green Namekian Oceans.  At the edge
of your vision you can see a dark shape, possibly another landmass.  The sense
of life is far stronger here, and you can even hear small sounds of life coming
from the other landmass, carried by the open water.  &00

   &00&06You fly over the sea of Namek, watching the waves roll beneath you.  
The sun's light bounces off the wave, and creates a rainbow that shoots back to
you.  Normally, it would take a day or two to make this crossing, but in
flight, it's only a few minutes.

   &00&06As you approach the far coast of the Straits, you can see the far
landmass better now.  It appears to be a fair-sized island, with a massive
pinnacle of rock jutting up into the sky.  You can see a large cluster of huts
on the isle, all rounded and bug-shaped.  The sense of life is strong here.

   &00&10You arrive at the docks on Guru Isle.  The docks themselves look to be
worn out, and the timbers rotted.  The building here are made of a white
cinderblock, which looks to have melted into a single piece.  Nameks move about
here and there, tending to their own business.  A dusty dirt road that appears
to start, or end, at the docks leads further into the town.  &00

   &00&10This is the central marketplace.  Though it is the largest commerce
center on&00 &02Namek&10, it hardly rivals anything on other planets.  The dirt
road from the docks moves through here, and branched east and west, but still
continues to head steadily northwards, towards the pinnacle of rock upon which
Guru himself lives.  Nameks move through the marketplace at a leisurely pace,
as though they have all the time they need.  &00

   &00&10This is the southwest corner of the central marketplace.  In this
corner, armor is sold.  The vendor, a tall dark haired human, sits beside a gin
still.  The dirt road from the docks moves through hereto the East, West and
North.

the door is a crudely painted sign reading "The Swamp".  The door stands open,
and there is an impressive display of combat accessories available for
purchase.  The owner is a tall, light haired human in a green uniform.  &00

   &00&10This is the same dusty dirt road that began at the docks.  You can see
it stretching up from the docks, towards the towering spire of rock.  It looks
to be a scar on the land as it cuts through knee-high grass on it's journey.  
There is a sense of peace about this village, something sanctimonious, pure.  
Monsters fear to come here, to this island, and you begin to wonder why....

   &00&02This corner of the market is presided over by a pair of old men, each
robed in blue, with deep hoods.  It is impossible to tell if they are Namekian,
Human, or somethign else all together.  They speak as one, when they speak, and
there is a kind of grim forebearance about them.  It seems darker here, and
behind them you can see a gaping entrance into a cave of utter darkness.  &00

   &00&10This corner of the marketplace has several tables arrayed to display
the wares.  The owner, a somewhat short, stocky human with large round glasses,
is walking around to different cages, set behind the tables, feeding animals.
As far as you can see, he has two rabbits, a hampster, two guinea pigs, a
mouse, a goat, a tortoise, a possum and a plastic box containing cockroaches.

   &00&03The mountain path continues to ascend here, making it's way higher up
the pinnacle of rock.  The sound of the waves is a faint echo here, and the
path has steepened considerably.  Ahead it goes through a narrow crevice in the

   &00&03There is some kind of force here in this pass, something that can be
felt, but not seen or heard.  Unlike the force in the village, this is not a
benevolent force, it is not pure.  Evil radiates from the very rocks, small

   &00&02The road, the path, begins to fade away, and surprisingly, grass
begins to grow again.  Like an eternal green wave it springs from the ground,
waving backwards towards the mansion sized house that can already be seen
around the bend.  &00

   &00&03The grass from below has spread, begining from it's razor line at the
crevice, up and around the whole plateau.  Near the house, it stands almost at
five feet tall, though there is a lower swathe that seems to replace the now
vanished path.  The door to the near mansion-sized building stands open, ready
to admit anybody.  &00

   &00&10Contrary to the outside appearance, this building appears to be one
massive room, housing the mammoth form of the Namek called Guru.  He looks down
at you, as it appears to be the only way he can look.  Several attendants stand
by, arms behind their backs.  &00

   &00&06This is the waiting room for the space-port.  People generally wait
here, as the name says, for those arriving from, or waiting to depart to, other
planets.  Several long cushioned benches are arrayed in the room, and more than
a few chairs.  About half are occupied.  &00

drastic, begining like the edge of a knife.  Large trees, looking completely
different from the normal trees on Namek, rise to the skies.  Large reeds rise
up, and there almost appears to be the beginings of a river here.  The water,
thick and brown, moves sluggishly and something unsavory moves beneath the
surface of the water....  &00

   &06Water cascades over the edge of a small cliff before you.  Leeches tumble
over the edge, and are smashed apart on the rocks a paltry 60 stories below.  
There is no path of descent.  It appears flight is the only possible means.

   &00&02There is more greenery down here, more life.  You can hear the call of
wild birds, and hear the sounds of wild animals moving in the brush nearby.  
You can also see large leeches swimming in the water of the river, held at bay
by the waterfall.  With a better view of the surrounding terrain, you can now
see a path leading deeper into the swamplands.  &00

Namekian Swamplands: Underground River~
&00&16THere is little light here, and no way to see where next to place your foot. You can hear, echoing from far below, the roar of some tremendous beast. It drowns out even the thunder of the waterfall. The only way down is to either jump, or fly.&00

   &00&16This room is somehow muffled from the sound of the roaring.  The
walls, roof and floor have massive gouges, as though something has attempted to
claw it's way free.  The roof itself on this room has tapered considerably to a
mere 6 foot opening.  Few of the monsters you have seen so far could pass here.

&00&02This is the branch, nearly as wide a four-lane highway, leading
northward.  There is some kind of power here.  Several mountain hawk swoop and
dive, seemingly completely at home here in this massive tree.  Bugs and
squirrels run rampant here, and there is a vast sense of life, nearly drowning
out everything ese.  &00

   &00&06This leave of the tree seems to be very swampish.  Water has pooled
and stagnated on the leaf, giving it an acrid, sour smell.  Eggs as large as
human newborn, some broken and some whole, sit all over the leaf.  &00

   &00&16The entrance to the cave is damp, and long tendrils of moss hang from
the ceiling.  Stalactites and stalagmites protruded from the roof and floor,
and there is a faint greenish glow from the back of the cave, off in the
darkness.

person, crushing, grasping, sucking the pleasure out of the air.  The only

   &00&16The floor stops here, at a massive, roughly shapen hole.  It's side
are draped with a glowing moss, it's light filling the whole room.  By that
faint light, skeletons can be seen, some dangling over the edge of the massive
pit, and some propped up against the walls.  &00

   &00&16The walls of the pit stretch down seeminly forever.  Only by flight
could a creature survive this descent.  The glowing moss hangs in long strings,

of the others.  It reveals a ragged opening, and a rough stone path leading
North.  The path looks to low to fly.  &00

blown larger by some great force.  It still curves, and is angled down, but a
sense, almost smell, of malevolent evil permeates the very air.  &00

   &03Now past the rock wall, which already closes, you can see the vastness of
the cavern before you.  A massive waterfall tumbles down the far side, and
culminates in a vast pool.  A river runs from tht pool, snaking it's way across
to this side f the cavern.  Several waterwheels are placed along it to collect
power.  &00

   &00&03This is one of the major intersections of the city.  Amethyst Street
and Amber Avenue meet here, and the combintion of their two inlays send up a
massive pillar of light, larger than any of the corners by far.  A large device
sits around the beam, controlling and stabilizing it, ensuring it doesn't
explode.  Four Sia'ngelius Knights patrol the intersection, making certain
nobody tampers with the controls.  &00

   &14The broad strip of amber stone comes to an end at a pillar of light,
mingling with the clear strip of diamond which stretches both East and West.  
Though not as large as the pillar in the centre of the city, it is still a
fairly large beam of light, with benches and what look to be students standing
around the pillar.  &00

   &00&14This is the intersection of Sapphire Street and Emerald Lane.  The two
gems inlaid into the streets come together in a magnificent pillar of light
here, reaching up to the cavern roof, and supplying light to this quarter of
the city.  There are some Sia'ngelius and Nameks standing about watching the
pilar of light endlessly cascade into the sky.  &00

   &00&14A broad strip of diamond runs both East and West, inlaid into the
street.  On the North side of the street are several buildings, shops and the
like.  To the South, however, is a massive compound, surrounded by a large
brick wall.  Sian'gelius Knights stand atop the walls, balls of energy held in
their hands.  &00

   &15This shop is dedicated to every type of senzu the owner can get it's hand
on.  If a senzu is obtainable, it is probably findable here.  Barrels of senzus
fill the store, with a persian rug near the back end where the strange shop
owner sits.  &00

   &15A large room expands out from this doorway, it's floor constructed of
weaved grass.  A small bedroom can be seen towards the back of the room, with a
large chair in front of it.  This looks like where the villagers keep up on
their training under the direction of the Elder.  &00

   &15The smooth top of this shipslops gently on it's round sides, adding a
dome feel to it.  The hull appears to be made out of exceptionally tough
material, with various window ports built into it.  The ship doesn't seem to
carry any external weapons, looking to be more like a transport ship.  &00

from its tattered rock.  The temple appears to have been built upon an oasis in
the middle of the Namekian Dry.  From here large shale stone steps lead up to a
massive iron door.  &00

   &00&03Without realizing it, you have arrived at the base of the spire.  It
rises out of the sea like a massive tooth, a testament to nature's own will.  
It stretches high into the distance, so high that the top cannot be seen
clearly.  &00

   &03This is the top of the spire, and possibly the top of the world.  All
around, there is a drop of tens of thousands of feet.  No plant life is present

Nail.  &00
