Passage to Prison Udaphos~
   The cooled passageway is lined with gleaming azure crystals.  Strangely
enough, no light is beaming onto them...  The ground is soft and fertile, yet
no plants can grow here without Aether's light to feed them.  The end of the
rocky corridor is covered in what appears to be a silver mist, yet thin
tendrils extend into the air, and move as if they can feel the presence of
other beings.  While the keepers of this place hold power, those wisps of
glowing energy will never allow the passage of unwarranted beings.

material, and always manages to stay dry.  A neon gretting sign has been placed

   &15This is the main hall of the manor.  The doors to the outside are made of
a solid, varnished oak, re-enforced on the inside with heavy, studded steel
bands.  The floor is made of marble, and the walls are paneled with an unknown
kind of wood.  There are three doors leading off the Hall, and a staircase
leading down.  A large onyx fountain sits in the center of hall, drawing the
eye with its contrast.  &00

wall, and a writing desk against another.  A closet is inset into the third

about on the floor, scattered or stacked near a large squashy armchair near a

   &00The light is muted, subdued in this room.  It filters in from four
windows, each facing a direction of the compass.  The floor is made f more of
the unknown wood, and the walls are made of marble.  Two large statues stand at
the far end of the room.  One is of Lilia, dressed in a flowing dress, the
other of Iovan, in a shirt and pants.  They are holding hands, and a series of
cunningly placed lights make them seem to glow.  There are no chairs, benches
or surfaces to sit on, save for the floor.  &00

A small chair is barely made out in the &00&04da&12r&15k&16n&12e&00&04ss&16, as well as three doors to other rooms in the hall and a black &15d&14i&15a&14m&15o&14n&15d&16 Chandelier that hovers about the &00&01f&09l&00&01a&09m&00&01e&16&00

&16This is where the &12H&00&04u&16n&15t&16e&00&04r&12s&16 train. The ground is covered in craters and blood stains can be seen on the ground. There is very little light to see by, so one must rely on there other senses. It is well known that &16S&15i&16l&15v&16e&15r&16 first went S&15h&16ad&15o&00w&16 in this room, and he constantly trains with the other hunters here, pushing their limits.&00
