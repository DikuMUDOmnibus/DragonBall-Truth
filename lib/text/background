 Dragonball Truth is the true form of a DBZ mud.
DBT is a branch off of another DBZ mud, in a
way. DBT came into being when some important players
(No matter what the other mud may claim) became fed
up with the cheating some Immortals of said mud were 
doing to help their mortal alternative players, as
well as the massive amounts of player abuse rampant
on said mud.

DBT was then thought up, and work began on it 
immeadiatly. 

**All things regarding the mud DBT branched off from
are opinion as they can't be proven. We all believe,
and or know they are true. But whether they are true
to the player, is up to the player. Also, not all imms
at the mud DBT branched off from cheated, or were
involved in player abuse. DBT was formed to create
an alternative to all this, and allow people to enjoy
a fun DBZ mud that they believe is fair, and of which
they can play without being abused for immortal enjoy-
ment.**
