[SFP was created by Tuzkino and Xylam and was the original source code for DBT.
Very little of it still remains a part of DBT, but it deserves credit none
the less.

Dragonball Truth was coded by: Iovan. All other mentions in the credits 
were used for the base code. Only basic functions such as olc, format, and
snippets from some nice people, are not coded by Iovan. Everything else was 
painstakingly coded in by Iovan, and or one or two helpers on a few things.]
