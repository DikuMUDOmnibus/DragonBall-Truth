&15Guardians get the following special abilities in rp.&00
&15They are able to sense danger to the planet/place they guard
as soon as it presents its self. This does not mean they can
pre-emptivly strike what they know to be a threat just from OOC
knowledge.

They also get the ability to draw from the planet's energy.
This happens as the ability to recharge 20% of their ki once in
any rp where they are protecting their planet. It takes a turn
of concentrating on just drawing help from the planet's lifeforms.

&15Send all requests for guardianship to any of the rp imms, it must be
well explained why you would be a good guardian. Any guardians that fail
at their duty will be KILLED by Iovan irp.

Help Dance of the Seven Dragons
&00&06------------------------&00

&15This technique's origin is a mystery, however it is a skill that most
half-breeds have been able to master over time and seems to be almost 
natural. It is a series of natural attack motions the user adds ki to, 
making them deadly, the user does these seven attacks to various parts
of an opponent's body. It is a quite devastating attack.&00

&09Rp&00

&15This technique is a series of quickly thrown punches, kicks, knees, and
elbows. This technique is an advanced form of zanzoken, having punches and
kicks thrown in other than pure defense. This technique takes 10% of your max
ki to use, and can only be used twice per rp. It does 7 times 3% of your base
pl, so the formula is - 1,000,000 pl = 30,000 x 7 = 210,000. This skill is really
useful if your pl heavily outwieghs your ki.&00

Help Merging

&15Beam and ball type attacks(ex: Kamehameha, ex: kishot) can be
merged into a single attack irp if fired from the same direction and
merged at their source. Medium and smaller attacks are the only kind
that can be merged. The two merged attacks comibe their total ki, and
the new attack is 90% of the total of the two attacks. Example: Two
5mil ki attacks merged will created a single 9mil attack.

A beam attack can not merge with a ball attack at this time. This type
of manuever can only be used by a pair once a rp. Even if the individuals
pair up with someone else in the same rp, they can not do it again.&00

Help Future Sight
&00&06------------------------&00

&15This ability is for rp only. It allows any kanassan to spend an
entire turn while in battle(not before, or after a battle) doing nothing
but peering into the future. This will cost them 15% of their max ki
(taken from current) and they can do nothing for that turn except
concentrate on future sight. After that turn they can act normally.

After a future sight has been done, the kanassan can choose any turn
DURING the battle to react to with forknowledge. This means that if
they choose that turn as the turn they spotted in the future, then
they can dodge any attack in it(for as many actions as they have)
or gaurantee the hit of any physical attack. They can only gaurantee
ki attacks that are medium or smaller.

One use per rp. While using futuresight the 'doing nothing' mentioned 
earlier covers dodging and speaking too.&00

fusion
&00&06------------------------&00
Help Fusion
&00&06------------------------&00

&15Fusion comes in two forms for rp. First there is the fusion dance,
which is learned from an imm or taught by an NPC, and requires 200 post
rp for both people learning it(400 if learned from an NPC, which means 
400 total between the two(or 800). Second is the fusion earrings, which
have to be wished for(1 wish per earring.)

Fusion dance fusions choose who will control them irp. That decision can
be changed at any point, and if there is a disagreement one or more of the
fusion can choose end the fusion which will occur because of an internal 
struggle that breaks the fusion. For fusion earrings, the two fused partners
trade off on making rp posts. One posts, then for their next turn the other
posts.

&14Fusion Dance&16: &15The users must be within 10% of each's other's
pl. And must be of similar looks and size. If a different race is fusing
together they have no transes. Add both pls and kis together. Lasts for
10 turns. Add both pls and kis together and then multiply them by 2, and
lasts for 8 turns. Two of same race get transes also, two of different
races get no transes.&00

Fusion Earrings&16: &15Permanant, users pl and ki added together, and Pl:
Times 5, Ki: Times 5.&00

receives 200k for the kill.&00

Help Group
&00&06------------------------&00

&15Groups are the best way to train. They allow safty in numbers,
the ability to take down large quest mobs, the ability to take down
more mobs faster. Groups on DBT give each member of the group better
than a small fraction exp gains. Example, if a group of three members kills
a mob worth 9mil exp, instead of each getting 3mil they would get 4.5mil.
This makes it worth group training as it can be at a slightly better
pace than solo training. To group with someone, you must be at least
50% of the leader's pl.

Groups provide great safty in PK/Stealing zones as well. If you enter a
pk stealing zone in a group you are NOT allowed to steal from or kill
anyone in that group while you are in the zone. You must leave the zone
to leave the group and be an enemy to those players.&00

Help Blocking
&00&06------------------------&00

&15You can block most anything in rp in some way. Listed below are the
available ways to block.&00

&11Physical Attacks&16: &15These can be blocked with any body part
at anytime if reasonable.
&11Ki attacks&16:&15You can block ki attacks only by charging at least
half the amount of ki in the attack into one or two hands, and slapping
the attack away. This only works if the user of the attack isn't pumping
energy into it. You can charge energy to do this kind of block at 2% of
your total ki per turn. You may not deflect the attack back.&00

&15You can also catch ki attacks and throw them back towards the user,
if you charge ki into your hands and have an equal amount charged into
them as the attack. This can only be done to ball attacks(example: Genki
Dama, Kishot, Spiritball.).&00

pumping
&00&06------------------------&00
Help Pumping
&00&06------------------------&00

&15Any Focus skill can continue to have energy charged into it.
The user has to remain in the spot they fired it from, and they
muar continue to charge energy into it at the same rate as before they
fired the attack. The pumping can be cut off at any time unless
two beam attacks hit each other(example: Galik gun hitting a 
kamehameha) If two attacks hit each other the orginators of the
attacks must pump energy into the attacks for 3 turns after they
hit. The one with the most energy wins the contest of attacks, 
and pushes both attacks into the other opponent.&00

&12Riding an Attack&00
&15You can ride explosions if you manage to fire a beam attack
that is at least 25% of the total ki in the explosion. You must
know the attack is coming or have a zanzoken to use. You must
pump into the beam attack after it contacts the explosion, or
else the attack will break and you will take its damage with the
explosion's.

Help Zanzoken
&00&06------------------------&00

&15Zanzoken is a skill that allows a player to move faster than
normal. In mud this raises your speed by 20, possibly allowing you
to hit for an extra round per turn.&00

&09Rp&00
&15Zanzoken is the technique where you blur from sight, reappearing
to a different location nearby. Zanzoken can move upto 200 feet
initially. If your opponent is 20% above your current pl, he is not
affected by the vanishing affects of zanzoken and can see you clearly.
Zanzoken can be used to move out of the way of attacks. For every 2 mill
base pl, add 100 feet to your zanzokens range. Can only be used every
3 turns. If it is used on one turn, then you have to wait 3 turns
before you use it again. It takes 5% ki to use zanzoken.&00

&15Icers can use a zanzoken after 2 turns of waiting at an additional cost
of 5% ki(10% total cost). Konatsus in the Shadow Shadow form instead of
an opponent needing to be 20% above the konatsu's pl to spot them in a
zanzoken, they will need to be 40% over.

post. While in combat, speed is slightly different. If you opponent is
within 10% of your base pl, they are equal in speed to you. This applies
to combat only. 

Kanassans have the ability to move double their base movement underwater,
acting as a permanent zanzoken, where zanzokening underwater quadruples it.&00

&09Combat Related Speed&16: &15Speed when performing an attack on someone during combat is different. It goes off of current pl, not base. And is measured in related percents. 10% difference, 10% faster/slower. Same for every 10% difference on up.

It takes up %3 percent of max ki, and adds that amount of ki onto your

&15Ingest is the majin ability where the user ingests a mob and
gains half that mob's pl and ki. This can be done up until the
majin has gone over 250k pl or ki.&00

&09Rp&00
&15Ingest in rp can be used only until 4 targets have been ingested.
The majin gains 15% of the max pl and ki of those ingested, and will
continue to gain pl and ki as the player grows. The ingested players
(no npcs) must wait 1 month before they may attempt to escape. Once
they escape they return to 50% of their pl and ki, and the majin who
they escaped is stuned for three turns unless they are about to be
attacked. After a player escaped the majinlosses the pl and ki they
gained from them. It takes a minimum of 3 turns to ingest a player
unless  they are candy, then it takes 1. During this time a player
can attempt to break free if they still have the power to, unless they
are otherwise incompassitated. A zanzoken/ingest combo that isn't 
countered traps the target, making it impossible for them to escape
during the 3 turns unless helped.&00

&15Absorb is a technique only Androids, and Bio-Androids are able to use.
It involves the user absorbing either ki from a target, or absorbing the
target completely. In the mud this allows Androids and Bios to raise their
pl and ki from absorbing mobs up until they pass up either 250k pl or ki,
and also when learned small ki attacks have a chance of being absorbed
and doing no damage while boosting the ki of the Android or Bio. Also
in mud, absorb can be used as an attack to absorb small amounts of pl and
ki refilling the user. In rp absorb can only be used on attacks that are 
smaller than large class, and either on weaker opponents to absorb them
or on stronger opponents to sap their energy.&00

&09Rp&00
&15A max of 3 people can be absorbed by a bio-android or Android. Absorbed
players are killed, and give 30% of their pl and ki at the time of absorbtion
to the Bio or Android. The person absorbed is dead, and in the afterlife after
being absorbed. If They are wished back to life, or otherwise are revived the
one who absorbed them loses the pl and ki they had gained. Androids can
only absorb someone's energy till they die, not swallow them. It amounts to
the same, but is slower, taking 5 turns instead of 1.

If the android or bio android is weaker than the target, they can absorb 5% 
the target's current pl per turn. This pl is not permanantly kept, it goes 
away after the fight.&00

raising a hand above one's head, forming a flattened disk of ki there
and forcing it to spin at a steady rate. The user then launches it at
a target. Destructo Disks are able to cut through most things, it is
a useful attack against a much stronger opponent. However it is easily

can no longer charge energy as they die, they can be healed to normal
if it is done before they die. Cut in half people will live for 5 turns
if left alone. A severed head will instantly kill anyone who isn't a

Help Angel 2
&00&06------------------------&00

&15This file will go over several aspects of how the Orainites or 'Angels'
of DBT act or feel, and several instances in their history.&00

&14Personality&16: &15Angels as they have come to be known are a reclusive
race. They are not reclusive from each other, but from other sentient races.
They are this way not because of fear or hatred, but because of a underlying
sense of superiority they have about themselves. This is a feeling of racial
nobility that makes them think less of other species. Angels are capapble of
getting along fine with other species, and do so often. However the way they
act or do things can tend to get on other species' nerves.&00

&14Statistics&16: &15These statistics are for the average untrained angel.
Angels are of moderate intelligence, holding the same level as humans in 
general. They do not prefer technology however and generally never ever 
excell in that area. They tend to be very wise, making good leaders
and have an inate magical ability that they used to be able to use to full
effect generations before. They were part of the reason their original universe
was destroyed and they had to leave, that shows how powerful they could become.
Their strength on average is about that of a human, except in their wings
which hvae the strength to hold aloft naturally 10 times their body weight.

&14History&16: &15Angels were a race that was magical from their begining.
After thousands of years of progress they attained the ability to portal to
other planets. This ability was reserved for the nobles of Orainas their
homeworld. After several hundred years of travel around their universe
the Orainites encountered another race, a technology based race. That
race feeling the Angels were too powerful and moving too far across the
universe declared war. This war lasted for only forty years as Angel colonies
gave out to the forces mounted against them. It was only the archmages at
Orainas that managed to save the race....and doom their old universe.
The archmages summoned forth a being so powerful that it could drain the
life from whole planets. Losing control of the being they had to abandon
their old universe as the being moved to destroy Orainas.&00

&15In Super Kanassan Second kanassans get the ability to use one turn
of concentrating to mind wrap. This allows them to disappear from the
awareness of the target for five turns as long as the Kanassan doesn't
attack the target. The kanassan can't be heard, sensed, seen, smelled
by the target during this time. If touched by the target, the kanassan
will still be a mystery to the target. This can be used once per rp
and takes up all the kanassan's ki to use. This does not work on kais
or other kanassans.&00

Truffle
	&15Truffles are an extremely technologically advanced race that 
used to live with the saiyans on planet Vegeta, before they were driven 
off by an outburst of warfare.  They appear mostly as miniature humans, 
relying on their various machines and computers to compensate for their 
lack of phsyical mass.  Their engineering skills have led to an advanced 
society and many of the inventions used around the universe.

lilia
   &16Lilia is the Goddess responsible for most of Namek.  Don't blame the
other Imms for it, it's mostly her fault.  She is a part-time builder, since
she's good at small areas, but planets are a little much.  She is also an
RP-Imm, and will participate in RP as often as she can.  Do not break RP rules,
because she's scary when you break the rules of her favorite place on the Mud.

&15 If she isn't on, feel free to ask Reign, since he watched her build most of Namek, and can answer most questions as well as she can.&00

hopfully not last step in the line. Dragon Ball Truth tries to stick
to the series in a lot of things, whenever we differ from it, it is 
only the expression of our creativity. Do not try and use DBZ as an 
excuse to get something changed, we may consider that but we will not
automaticly change everything to be DBZ. Some things DBZ has do not 
translate well to muds, and our goal is for a great mudding experience
for our players.

DBT makes its main goal to be fun for the majority of players, our 
secondary goal being to be the fairest DBZ mud around. We enforce our
rules, no matter who you are, no favortism will have a play in our mud.
With all that said, we would like you to enjoy the mud, you follow the

transrp
&15
Transformations in rp do not last continually as they do in the mud.
Transes only last in rp for a certain amount of posts before an rper 
must power down. This makes transes more strategic than your run of the
mill DBZ mud. Add 1 posts to the base amount of any trans for every 10mil
base powerlevel you have. And for higher transes you do not add a lower
trans's post total to the higher trans's. When your time runs out for a
trans you must rp reverting and you must wait twice the trans's length
before you can use it again. If reverting drops your pl below 1, you drop
to 1 pl instead and go unconcious.

&15Regenerate is a skill that allows the user to regenerate their
powerlevel at some cost to their ki, it also specificly regenerates
lost body parts.&00

&09Rp&00
&15In rp this skill can restore body parts, and heal up to 5% of the
user's base pl per turn. It costs 20% ki to use once, it continues
to regenerate until stopped, interupted by a focus attack, or has
lasted for more than 4 turns.&00

In regards to loss of head.
&15Majins: Majins can regenerate their head as long as they have 25% of 
their base pl. Otherwise they die if their head is severed or destroyed.

Bios: Bios regenerate their heads like majins only they need 30% base pl 
to survive the loss of their head to regenerate it.

Nameks: Nameks can regenerate as long as their head is intact. If the head 
is removed from their body they regenerate a new body and the old one 
dies. if their head is not whole the namek dies.

will be able to fight each other. The winner will get the pk, and the other
person's 5k zenni.&00

kaioken

&15Kaioken is a technique in which the user over works their body to
increase their powerlevel for a short period of time. This technique
was made most famous by Goku in his fight with Vegeta.

On the mud kaioken lasts for 1 mud hour. So if it is used at the
begining of a mud hour it will last the whole hour, but if it is used
near the end it won't last very long, so be careful.

It is also best to go straight to a kaioken form, and not to work your
way up, or you may end up wasteing ki.&00

commands

Help Commands
&00&06------------------------&00

&15This is a list of commands for new players to keep in mind, these
commands make playing easier and fun.

&11get all all&16: &15This will clean out any containers in a room you 
have access to, including corpses, and is great for quickly getting the
loot from said corpses.
&11get all.(topic)&16: &15This will get all of a certain object from 
available containers. Such as if you want to get all of your senzus from
a bag, you would type get all.senzu bag.
&11wimpy&16: &15This is a command you can use to make your character flee
from a fight whenever they drop below a certain amount of pl. Example:
wimpy 5000, this will make your character flee when they drop below 5000 
pl.
&11alias&16: &15This command allows you to make In Mud Aliases(&00&07tm&15)
these can be used for doing a set amount of commands VIA alias stack, 
Example: alias y kishot; kishot; kishot;  this alias here will make you
fire 3 kishots after pressing and entering y. An even more advanced version
of this would be, Example: alias boom kishot $*; kishot; kishot;  this right
here would fire the first kishot at the accompaning target, if you had typed
boom Fighter, your first kishot would have hit any fighter present, and the
rest would follow hitting who you are fighting(the fighter now). $* in the
In Mud Aliases is meant as a substitute, whatever you type after the alias
on the command line will be put in place of the $*. Now this makes 
constructing OOC aliases fun, as you can have what you say sandwiched between
an alias.&00
&11stat&16: &15this command allows you to see what stats an equipment will
give you. Read help stat2&00

auction
&00&06------------------------&00
Help Auction
&00&06------------------------&00

&15Auctions are an easy way to sell any items you may have, when placed
on auction the entire mud has a chance to buy the item for the designated
price. Most shops buy back most items for at most half price on DBT, so
when auctioning it can be helpful to keep that in mind, auctioning an item
for less than half it's price is stupid. Auctions on DBT are meant to be 
competitive so rarely will anything be auctioned far below it's resale value.

&15Do not auction something more than 3 times in a row if no one is buying it
give it a rest for a while so other's may have a chance to auction something,
or so you do not spam everyone's screens with your repeated auctions.&00

money
&00&06------------------------&00
Help Money
&00&06------------------------&00

&15Money on DBT is known as Zenni of course, but unlike most DBZ muds, our
money and economy is geared to be comprehensive, and not a big inflation 
storm. It is a high value economy in any case, mostly everything has a value
and can be sold at some place on the mud. The mobs give controlled amounts
of money, so even though that is the main way to make money, it is not the 
only way.

Also there are a few skills that can help increase a person's cash. Mug can
steal away money(As long as you are in a stealing zone!!!), certain race 
skills can make items that can be sold if players have a need for them. 
Lastly some mobs and mob zones load with treasure items. Only a certain 
amount of these load per reboot, unless some are stupidly junked. These 
treasure items can be sold for great profit at certain shops, and their only
use is to be sold.&00

inventory
&00&06------------------------&00
Help Inventory
&00&06------------------------&00

&15This command allows you to view your inventory. DBT is built to strongly
prohibit or control hoarding junk. Everything has a value and can be sold,
and also you can only hold as many items as double your strength. This keeps
people from holding onto millions of junk items and then causeing the mud to
lag or even crash.

You can however hold more than double your strength if you buy a bag, bags 
can hold an additional 25 items in them, anyone found hoarding junk in bags 
will have those bags junked. Whenever you log on, a bag will be emptied so 
you will be carrying it all this will prevent you from getting ANYTHING new 
however, so it is advised that you put all the items into their bag when you
log on. As a side note, if you plan on entering a stealing zone, it is best
to have stuff in a bag and closed up as it makes stealing individual items
harder(but then they might just steal the bag....)&00

newbie

&15These are some tips for newbie players, or just about any player who
may need them.

&111&16: &15Always explore, there may be great things just around the 
corner. Don't give up on an area just because it doesn't appear to have
anything.
&112&16: &15You should always let a mob finish talking, there may be 
something important said.
&113&16: &1599% of DBT's items can be sold at some place. So don't junk
stuff unless you are lazy, you might be able to earn some more zenni,
especially if you find treasure items.
&114&16: &15Don't be afraid to ask an Immortal for help, DBT's imms work
here to keep the game fun. As long as you obey the rules, you need not 
worry about them.
&115&16: &15All newbie leveling zones are located near recall points,
so they are not hard to find if you try.
&116&16: &15Read help files, you never know what helpful command or skill
you may discover this way.
&117&16: &15Save up your money, you never know when you may need it for
a better piece of equipment. Better equipment, equals better stats, equals
better pl/ki/lp gains etc.&00
&118&16: &15If you are having a problem sending tells to a player with
a name similar to a mob's, try adding p. before their name. This will make
whatever action you are trying target a player with that name.&00

iovan
   &15Iovan is the head coder of DBT, most of DBT was coded by him, so thank
him if you enjoy it.  Iovan also has built a large amount of the mud, but he
prefers coding, so when he can help it he won't be building.  &00 &15Do not
bother Iovan constantly, he will check up on players enough as it is.  If Iovan
is AFK flagged, leave him be.  Iovan likes to be fair, and will not care who
you are when you break a rule, he will make sure you get punished appropriatly.

zones will not be tolerated. Only exception is in clan halls or
if two clans are at war. You can PK someone outside a pk zone if
they give you an IC reason under the following criteria: Spams
the room you are in, insults your character blatantly, steals one
of your mobs while you are in the room, or steals a drop from
a mob you were killing or killed.

&15War between TWO CLANS ONLY lasts for 10 days and can't be
redeclared for a week afterwards. The whole purpose of this
is to open both clans up to pking anywhere. This doesn't
cover stealing.

Help Roleplay
&00&06------------------------&00

&15These are a basic set of rules for roleplayers to follow.  Just
remember to abide by them.&00

&111&16-&15Use common sense.  If you have a lot weaker pl than someone.
You really aren't going to beat them.
&112&16-&15Don't argue over roleplay.
&113&16-&15Don't use ooc information for roleplay.
&114&16-&15No auto-hits.  But like I said, use common sense. The one
being attacked decides how they were hit, not the attacker. If an
attack would hit you bad, play it that way don't be a bitch, what is rp
worth if you can't play it right.
&115&16-&15No god roleplaying.  Which means you aren't invincible.
&116&16-&15Respect an rp imms ruling. Do not listen to ANY other player
unless they are backed up by a clearly stated rule. If something isn't
clear an rp imm will rule on it and make it clear.
&117&16-&15No maniac roleplaying. This doesn't mean you can't be evil to
the core, or a crazy bastard. But if you ARE you need to roleplay the
reasons why you go crazy on something, actual roleplay the mental
problems. If you are crazy you do not instantly become sane anytime you
face a stronger opponent and want to flee, this kind of behavior will 
result in rp banning.
&118&16-&15Follow these basic rules and roleplay will be fun and
encourageable.
&119&16-&15l33t, or leet, will not be accepted in any rp. If it is seen
it will be junked. Use proper english and grammer to the best of your 
ability.
&1110&16-&15You must list your current ki and pl when it changes irp
do this over qsay. The other rpers can not use that info irp unless
they have powersense or a scouter. This rule is so people can make sure
charge rules and the like are being followed.&00

Help Mindfreeze

   &15This skill uses the user's immense power of the mind in order to paralyze
their enemies, rendering them unable to run, attack, or use any form of ki
manipulation. It also does a good deal of damage to the target. It can only be
used on mobs, and only mobs that are no more than 10x the pl of the user.

&09Rp&00
&15The user of this can preform mindfreeze once every 10 turns. And it only
lasts for 3 turns. It can only be used on one target per use, and the user
must use their full concentration to maintain the hold. The mindfrozen
player can not move at all or control their ki, they stand or hover where
they were. The user can do nothing but block while they hold the target
still, not even walk or run. They must maintain eye contact as well. Also
mindfreeze can only be used on targets that are no more than 25% stronger
than the user. It costs 12% of the user's ki to preform.&00

The 2% ki cost doesn't kick in until the human's trans time runs out, that
is when determination kicks in if it was used already. Or it could be used
the very turn the trans is to run out. If the human reaches less than 2% ki

raise Upper Body Skill and Lower Body Skill as well. The
amount of exp gained depends on the people sparring, and on
whether the person getting hit is blocking or not. If they
are blocking the person blocking will get more exp than the
attacker. If they are not blocking then the attacker will get
more experience.&00

GROUP
   &15Group can be used to form fighting parties, these help players bring down
larger enemies easier, or bring down enemies at a faster pace.  Group
experience gain is better than a fraction on DBT.  Two people grouped together
would get half the mob's exp x 1.  75.  Three would get one third of the mob's
exp x 1.  75, etc.  In this way group leveling can be very useful.  Also, to
group anyone they must be following you.  If you are already in a group, and
just type group, it will display the pl and ki of the group members.  This
helps a group leader keep track of his or her group's status, for better
fighting.  &00

#0

for more information.

See also: BOARDS, MAIL






#0
BOARDS

Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6

circlemudcredits
CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink and George Greer, for submitting a veritable mountain of
     excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2, and Jack Patton and Steffen Haeuser for the
     Amiga port.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
  -- Jules (hamotek sheli) for being the greatest.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

SOCIALS

Usage: <social> [<victim>]

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion and not to take action,
but it is possible that some mobs (or players) will take action based on
the social.  (Slap a dragon lately?)

Example:

  > shake homer
  > applaud marge
  > stare

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

  > socials

#999999
SET

Usage: set [ file | player ] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields (BINARY), the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

The following are valid fields:

SHUTDOWN

Usage: shutdown [reboot | die | pause]

SHUTDOWN shuts the MUD down.  The SHUTDOWN command works in conjunction with
CircleMUD's 'autorun' script.  If you are not using autorun, the arguments are
meaningless.  If you are using autorun, the following arguments are available:

REBOOT     Pause only 5 seconds instead of the normal 40 before trying to
           restart the MUD.

DIE        Kill the autorun script; the MUD will not reboot until autorun is
           explicitly run again.

PAUSE      Create a file called 'paused' in Circle's root directory; do not
           try to restart the MUD until 'paused' is removed.
