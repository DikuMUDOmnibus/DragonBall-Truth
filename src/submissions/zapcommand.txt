Howdy there,

Wrote this little wonder a while back in an awful fit of boredom. It
started out as just a reworking of the 'restore' command but as I started
thinking about it more and more and then Star Trek ended.. I realized that
it could be so much more! So this is it, I guess.. the ZAP command!
(Muahaha!) It's perfect for the masochist in us all. I got the idea from
the MUD I used to play on before I started doing drugs, got in trouble,
stopped doing drugs, went to rehab, got bored and started my own MUD..
except that zap command was for pussies and guys that like quiche. I
wanted mine to have some umph. Using a percentage system is nice because
there is no percentage of 0, meaning you can't kill the player if you
accidentally(uhh, oops..) over-zap them(ex. some player gossips something
about your mother and then infers some sexual act with livestock and
another immortal of a lower level happens to zap them at the same time as
you, as you were invisible or some shit. Whatever.)

Anyhow, here it is. I assume you know how to set up a new wiz command..

/* DeoMUD Zap command.. wicked! */
ACMD(do_zap)
{

  /* Zapping mobiles was fun at first.. */

  struct char_data *vict;
  int WASHIT,	WASMANA,	WASMOVE;

  int NHIT,	NMANA,		NMOVE;
  float ZAPMULT; /* Yeah, I know this produces a warning.. *
                  * If that bugs ya, fix it..              */



/* This is just a reminder for me *

  one_argument(argument, buf);

	  vict = ch;}


   /* This most assuredly isn't the best way to set all this up but for

    WASMANA = GET_MANA(vict);  /* them into holding.. */

    sprintf(buf, "(GC) %s zapped %s for %dH, %dM, %dV (stats * %d)",

    send_to_outdoor("The sky begins to darken, and clouds loom ominously overhead.\r\n");
    send_to_outdoor("Suddenly the clouds part and a bolt of lightning jumps from\r\n");
    send_to_outdoor("the opening left in the sky, striking HARD!\r\n");
    send_to_char(OK, ch); /* Same here.. yeah */
    act("\\c01Ahh shit! You got zapped! Better get yourself in line!\\c00", FALSE, vict, 0, ch, TO_CHAR);

}



Yeah, have fun with it.. hack it to pieces, whatever. If you change it for
the better, let me know. E-mail pklep@match.org
