Hello, My name is Gad and I am a newbie coder. I am 14 years old.
I figure if i wanna get experience i'd better start early. Well i
just want to submit the first piece of code that I developed from
scratch, by myself.

***(made in patch level 16)****
***First go to act.wizard.c. ***
***Among the other commands, adD:***
ACMD(do_slay);

*** Now, add the code: ***

ACMD(do_slay)
{
  struct char_data *vict;


  one_argument(argument, buf);


  if (IS_NPC(ch)) {
     send_to_char("You can't slay. Try returning. \r\n", ch);
     return;
   }
 if ((vict = get_char_vis(ch, buf, FIND_CHAR_ROOM)) != NULL) {
    if(!IS_NPC(vict) && (GET_LEVEL(ch)) <= (GET_LEVEL(vict))) {
     send_to_char( "Go slay someone your own size. \r\n", ch);
     return;
    }
  act("$n slays $N in cold &rblood&n. \r\n", FALSE, 0, 0, ch, TO_NOTVICT);
  act("You slay $N in cold &rblood&n. \r\n", TRUE, ch, 0, vict, TO_CHAR);
  act("$n slays you in cold &rblood&n. \r\n", FALSE, ch, 0, vict, TO_VICT);
     return;
   }

   raw_kill(vict, ch);
   return;
  } else {
    send_to_char("Who do you wish to slay? \r\n", ch);
    return;
   }
  if (IS_NPC(vict)) {
   extract_char(vict);
  }
}

*** Now, go to interpreter.c ***
*** Among the other commands, preferably before the sleep command, or
    whatever would come after slay in alphabetical order, add: ***

ACMD(do_slay)

*** Now, further down, above the command which you put slay above
    earlier, add this : ***

{ "slay  "   , POS_RESTING , do_slay ,LVL_GOD, 0},
                                    
*** You can put whatever you want the minimum level for the command to be
    in place of LVL_GOD ***
-------------------------------------------------

After that just compile your mud and it should work. It will come up with
a minor error, but it will work with it. if anyone can upgrade this or fix
any bugs with it please email me with modifications or bugfixes.
