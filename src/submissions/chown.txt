Subject: Change Ownership Command

Thanks to everyone that input to this command, I feel like it is ready
for public consumption, and would like to submit it for everyone to use
freely.

-- Insert at end of act.wizard.c --

/* Change Ownership of item from player to IMM
   Idea from Highlands II (hlii.highlands.org 9001)

   Additional code by:

   Thanks to everyone that helped make this command! */

Note: I am a 50 level system with 10 god levels 51-60, my load command is
level 54, so I feel that anyone that can load should be able to chown.

If you use this snippet please gimme a hollar and the mud you're using it
on I'd like to come see how you're doing with it.  This is my first real
command that I started on my own, and the help from this list has been
priceless.
