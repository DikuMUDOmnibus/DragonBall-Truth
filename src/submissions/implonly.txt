Subject: CODE: Implementor Only Room Flag

Ok before you read any more this might
seem kind of lame, why would you need
an impl. only flag, but anyway it's a
contribution towards room flags.
I hope this helps someone.

This is my first ever code I wrote in C,
it's also the first ever code I applied
to my CircleMUD(bpl17). First time I ever
made my own code completely and it worked
flawlessly the first time I compiled & rebooted.
Yep im pleased by my work heheh. =)

Ok on with the code:
<<<<<<<<<<(Open) structs.h >>>>>>>>>>
(1) Search for a: "ROOM_DARK"
You should see a list of define's for ROOM_FLAGS.
Like this:
#define ROOM_DARK		(1 << 0)   /* Dark		*/
#define ROOM_DEATH		(1 << 1)   /* Death trap	*/
#define ROOM_NOMOB		(1 << 2)   /* MOBs not allowed	*/


(2) At the bottom of that list, add in your own code
such as I did: (copy paste the line above OR type it carefully.)

#define ROOM_IMPLONLY         (1 << 17)  /* Implementor Only Security 	*/
                                    ^^
But, make sure to change this number^^so that it is next in order, 15, 16 => 17.
etc. So if your last number was 15, make that number a 16.

You can make the ROOM_MYNAME tag however you want but I think you need to
leave the ROOM_ part.  Examples: ROOM_COWS ROOM_COWSONLY ROOM_IMPLONLY


<<<<<<<<<<(Save&Close) structs.h >>>>>>>>>>
<<<<<<<<<<(Open) constants.c >>>>>>>>>>

(1) Search for a: "PEACEFUL" (w/ quotes)

You should find a room flag list. i.e. TUNNEL, DARK, NOMOB, !MAGIC etc.

At the very bottom of the list, but before the "\n" line, add in your
flag's name. It can be different from the flag you put in before.
It can be IMPLONLY or IONLY or whatever you wish, I am not sure on the
limit of characters/letters but I would say keep it less than or close to 10.

Also, add a comma after your entry here. It tells the program to keep going.

Example:


  "ATRIUM",
  "OLC",
  "*",		/* BFS MARK */
+ "IMPLONLY",
  "\n"
};



<<<<<<<<<<(Save&Close) constants.c >>>>>>>>>>

Ok, now you have created a room flag that works.
You will have to determine what the bitvector is
for your world files. example: if the last room on your
building document was:

p BFS_MARK	32768 Reserved

(Then the next one would be...)

q IMPLONLY      65536


Now, you have a room flag (duh yea i said it already)
but, now you have to make it do something.
Let's make is so only an implementor can go into a room.

<<<<<<<<<<(Open) act.movement.c >>>>>>>>>>

(1) Search for a: "ROOM_GODROOM" (w/o quotes)
(2) This part of act.movement.c checks to see if you can go
where you want to. If youre too exausted (no mv pts), and
you try to go north, the code here wont let ya. Same for
god rooms, tunnels, houses, etc etc.

Anyway:!: You should find a chunk of code that looks like this:


  /* Mortals and low level gods cannot enter greater god rooms. */
  if (ROOM_FLAGGED(EXIT(ch, dir)->to_room, ROOM_GODROOM) &&
	GET_LEVEL(ch) < LVL_GRGOD) {
    send_to_char("You aren't godly enough to enter that room!\r\n", ch);
    return (0);
  }


(3) Select & Copy the one you found, and after the last bracket } on the
code you found & just copied, press enter a few times and get some space
then paste your code in.

(4) Change:

  if (ROOM_FLAGGED(EXIT(ch, dir)->to_room, ROOM_GODROOM) &&
                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                      Change THIS ^^ to your
room flag from the first part of this lil tutorial thing.

(5)Thennnnnnn...
Change the 'Youre not godly enough to blabla' to something
you like, I put 'And you are? Raven? I dont think so.'
-however you wish-

Then save & Close, and thennnn put that bitvector you figured out
for your new flag...................


example: if the last room on your
building document was:
p BFS_MARK	32768 Reserved
(Then the next one would be...)
q IMPLONLY      65536

............just slap that flag into a room.
Then compile & reboot & try it out.


Hope this helped, if you dont mind please slap my name in your credits file.
