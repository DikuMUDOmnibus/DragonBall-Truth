NoRecall roomflag by Cathy Gore

Little note: For use with OasisOLC 2.0, Tested on a CircleMUD 3.0 bpl 17.

Ever have a room that was just so magically encased that recall just
shouldn't work there?  This adds a nice little norecall roomflag to your
existing flags.  Neither the spell_recall or do_recall will work in rooms
with this flag.

Here's the snippet:
--------------------------------------
in act.other.c, ACMD(do_recall):

     send_to_char("Monsters can't recall!!\r\n", ch);
     return;
   }
+
+  if (ROOM_FLAGGED(IN_ROOM(ch), ROOM_NORECALL)) {
+    send_to_char("A magical shroud prevents recall!\r\n", ch);
+    return;
+  }
+
---------
in constants.c, at the end of const char *room_bits[]:
+  "!RECALL",
   "\n"
 };
--------- 
in oasis.h, add 1 to the NUM_ROOM_FLAGS
---------
in spells.c, ASPELL(spell_recall):
 {
   if (victim == NULL || IS_NPC(victim))
     return;
+  if (ROOM_FLAGGED(IN_ROOM(victim), ROOM_NORECALL)) {
+    send_to_char("A magical shroud prevents recall!\r\n", victim);
+    return;
+  }
---------
in structs.h, with the roomflag defines:
+#define ROOM_NORECALL  (1 << 21)  /* Recalling not allowed  */
 
 /* Exit info: used in room_data.dir_option.exit_info */
 #define EX_ISDOOR		(1 << 0)   /* Exit is a door		*/

--------------------------------------
And that's it!  Recompile and reboot, and add your flags!
