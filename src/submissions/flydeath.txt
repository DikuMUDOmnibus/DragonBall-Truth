Flydeath Room Flag by: Cathy Gore

Little note: For use with OasisOLC, tested on a CircleMUD 3.0 bpl17.

This room flag adds a little twist to the ROOM_DEATH flag.  It is still a
death trap, but with this flag, if the character is flying, the room will
just be a normal room.  For example, your death trap is something to the
effect of falling out of a window.  A person who is flying obviously isn't
going to fall to their death, cuz they'll just kinda float out.

So, here's the snippet:
----------------------------------
To find the spots, search for ROOM_DEATH...

in act.informative.c, void look_at_room:

-  if ((!IS_NPC(ch) && !PRF_FLAGGED(ch, PRF_BRIEF)) || ignore_brief ||
-      ROOM_FLAGGED(ch->in_room, ROOM_DEATH)) {
+  if ((!IS_NPC(ch) && !PRF_FLAGGED(ch, PRF_BRIEF)) || ignore_brief) {

and after the desc is sent to the char:

+  if (GET_LEVEL(ch) < LVL_IMMORT && (ROOM_FLAGGED(ch->in_room, ROOM_DEATH) || (ROOM_FLAGGED(ch->in_room, ROOM_FLYDEATH) && 
+    !IS_AFFECTED(ch, AFF_FLYING)))) {
+    send_to_char("You have DIED!\r\n", ch);
+    return;
+  }

----
in act.movement.c, do_simple_move:

-  if (ROOM_FLAGGED(ch->in_room, ROOM_DEATH) && GET_LEVEL(ch) < LVL_IMMORT) {
+  if ((ROOM_FLAGGED(ch->in_room, ROOM_DEATH) || (ROOM_FLAGGED(ch->in_room, ROOM_FLYDEATH) &&
+    !IS_AFFECTED(ch, AFF_FLYING))) && GET_LEVEL(ch) < LVL_IMMORT) {

----
in act.offensive.c, ACMD(do_flee):

-	!ROOM_FLAGGED(EXIT(ch, attempt)->to_room, ROOM_DEATH)) {
+	!ROOM_FLAGGED(EXIT(ch, attempt)->to_room, ROOM_DEATH) && 
+  !ROOM_FLAGGED(EXIT(ch, attempt)->to_room, ROOM_FLYDEATH)) {

----
in act.wizard.c, ACMD(do_show):

       if (ROOM_FLAGGED(i, ROOM_DEATH))
 	sprintf(buf + strlen(buf), "%2d: [%5d] %s\r\n", ++j,
 		GET_ROOM_VNUM(i), world[i].name);
+      if (ROOM_FLAGGED(i, ROOM_FLYDEATH))
+        sprintf(buf + strlen(buf), "%2d: [%5d] %s (fly)\r\n", ++j, 
+        GET_ROOM_VNUM(i), world[i].name);

----
in mobact.c, mobile_activity:

-	!ROOM_FLAGGED(EXIT(ch, door)->to_room, ROOM_NOMOB | ROOM_DEATH) &&
+	!ROOM_FLAGGED(EXIT(ch, door)->to_room, ROOM_NOMOB | ROOM_DEATH | ROOM_FLYDEATH) &&

----
in spec_assign.c, assign_rooms:

-      if (ROOM_FLAGGED(i, ROOM_DEATH))
+      if (ROOM_FLAGGED(i, ROOM_DEATH | ROOM_FLYDEATH))

----
in structs.h, where the roomflags are defined:

+#define ROOM_FLYDEATH  (1 << 20)  /* Death trap for those not flying */
//or whatever number is next for you

----
in oasis.h:

add one to your NUM_ROOM_FLAGS

----
in constants.c:

add "FLYDEATH", to the end of *const char *room_bits[] (but before the "\n")

----

And that's it!  Recompile and reboot, and save away!
