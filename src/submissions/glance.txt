This is my first snippet to contribute to the community, so I hope I do this
right.  (=  I wrote this to improve the glance command.  With this, you can
glance at any mobile or PC by doing ("glance <name>") but when you're fighting
someone, you can type "glance" and it assumes you're wanting to glance at the
fightee.

It's been a while since I wrote this, so I'm not sure what the stock "glance"
command is, but if there is one, just replace it with the following function.
If it's not there, you'll need to go into interpreter.c and add the standard
new command stuff.

Forgive me for not being too good about commenting my code.  Here it is anyhow:

ACMD(do_glance)
{
  int percent, bits, found = FALSE;
  struct char_data *i;
  struct char_data *found_char = NULL;
  struct obj_data  *found_obj  = NULL;

  half_chop(argument, arg, buf2);

	if (*arg)
	{
		bits = generic_find(arg, FIND_CHAR_ROOM, ch, &found_char, &found_obj);


  	if ((i = found_char) != NULL)
    {
		  if (GET_MAX_HIT(i) > 0)
  		  percent = (100 * GET_HIT(i)) / GET_MAX_HIT(i);
	  	else
  	  	percent = -1;		/* How could MAX_HIT be < 1?? */

		  strcpy(buf, PERS(i, ch));

		  if (percent >= 100)
  		  strcat(buf, " is in excellent condition.\r\n");
	  	else if (percent >= 95)
  	  	strcat(buf, " has a few scratches.\r\n");
		  else if (percent >= 85)
  		  strcat(buf, " has some small wounds and bruises.\r\n");
	  	else if (percent >= 75)
  	  	strcat(buf, " has some minor wounds.\r\n");
		  else if (percent >= 63)
  		  strcat(buf, " has quite a few wounds.\r\n");
	  	else if (percent >= 50)
  	  	strcat(buf, " has some big nasty wounds and scratches.\r\n");
		  else if (percent >= 40)
  		  strcat(buf, " looks pretty hurt.\r\n");
	  	else if (percent >= 30)
  	  	strcat(buf, " has some large wounds.\r\n");
		  else if (percent >= 20)
  		  strcat(buf, " is in bad condition.\r\n");
	  	else if (percent >= 10)
  	  	strcat(buf, " is nearly dead.\r\n");
		  else if (percent >= 0)
  		  strcat(buf, " is in awful condition.\r\n");
	  	else
  	  	strcat(buf, " is bleeding awfully from big wounds.\r\n");

  		CAP(buf);
    }
    else
	  	strcpy(buf, "Who do you wish to glance at?\r\n");

  }
	else
  {
  	if (FIGHTING(ch))
    {
			i = FIGHTING(ch);
		  if (GET_MAX_HIT(i) > 0)
	  	  percent = (100 * GET_HIT(i)) / GET_MAX_HIT(i);
		  else
  		  percent = -1;		/* How could MAX_HIT be < 1?? */

		  strcpy(buf, PERS(i, ch));

		  if (percent >= 100)
  		  strcat(buf, " is in excellent condition.\r\n");
	  	else if (percent >= 95)
  	  	strcat(buf, " has a few scratches.\r\n");
		  else if (percent >= 85)
  		  strcat(buf, " has some small wounds and bruises.\r\n");
	  	else if (percent >= 75)

    }
